# cat_kx3
CAT(Computer Aided Transceiver) application for ELECRAFT [KX3](http://www.elecraft.com/KX3/kx3.htm "KX3") for [NetBSD](https://www.netbsd.org/ "NetBSD")

It can operate VFO, modulation mode, operation band and send CW with CAT.
It will probably work with [KX2](http://www.elecraft.com/KX2/kx2.htm "KX2").
